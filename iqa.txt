Image quality assessment (IQA) is mainly divided into two areas of research (1) reference-based evaluation and (2) no-reference evaluation. The main difference is that reference-based methods depend on a high-quality image as a source to evaluate the difference between images. An example of reference-based evaluations is the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) [2].


Image Quality Assessment (IQA) algorithms take an arbitrary image as input and output a quality score as output. There are three types of IQAs:

Full-Reference IQA: Here you have a ‘clean’ reference (non-distorted) image to measure the quality of your distorted image. This measure may be used in assessing the quality of an image compression algorithm where we have access to both the original image and its compressed version.

Reduced-Reference IQA: Here you don’t have a reference image, but an image having some selective information about it (e.g. watermarked image) to compare and measure the quality of distorted image.

Objective Blind or No-Reference IQA: The only input the algorithm gets is the image whose quality you want to measure. This is thus called, No-Reference or Objective-Blind.

the strength of encryption lies not only in the complexity of the encryption algorithm, but also in the strength, randomness and complexity of the key

3. Performance in terms of time consuming and
security analysis

The proposed algorithm is tested using a C compiler, a
PC with 3.1 GHz processor Intel Core ¢ i3-2100 CPU, 4 GB
RAM, and Windows 7, 32-Bit Operation System. The proposed algorithm was applied to the Lena.bmp image of
different sizes (128  128  3, 256  256  3, 512  512  3
and 1024  1024  1). The average encryption/decryption
times, the average encryption throughput and the average
number of cycles per byte of the proposed algorithm, and
some known chaos-based cryptosystems are given in
Tables 3–5. The average time is calculated as follows: we
executed our algorithm 100 times and for each time we
computed the encryption/decryption times for the whole
image, with r¼1 and 2. Then, we calculated the average
consuming time, the average encryption throughput and
the average number of cycles per byte.


The decryption process is almost similar to the encryption one.

Furthermore, the decryption process uses the same chaotic
generator of the encryption part.




Diffusion

There are two reasons for introducing diffusion in an encryption algorithm. On one hand, the diffusion processing
can render the discretized chaotic map non-invertible. On the other hand, it can significantly change the statistical
properties of the plain-image by spreading the influence of each bit of the plain-image all over the cipher-image. For a
secure encryption scheme, a mechanism of diffusion is therefore necessary; otherwise the opponent can break the
cryptosystem by comparing a pair of plain-text and cipher-text to discover some useful information. For the purpose of
diffusion, the ‘‘XOR plus mod’’ operation will be applied in the new scheme, to each pixel in between every two adjacent
rounds of the 3D cat map. This is further detailed below.



The main problem comes from the drawback of the image encryption structure, which helps the attacker to find out the relationship between the cipher image and the secret keys or the plain
image. 




Outloine

The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, a brief introduction of the original image encryption scheme is presented and some typical attacks are listed. Section 3 indicates the drawbacks of the original image encryption scheme and
demonstrates how to implement the chosen-plaintext attack/chosen-ciphertext attack. In Section 4, some simulation examples are used to illustrate our attack in details. The comparison between our attack and Li and Lo’s attack is drawn in Section 5. Section 6 introduces an improved image encryption based on the ‘self-correlation’ algorithm, and Section 7 presents
the corresponding experiments and analyses results about it. In Section 8, the future work on improvement is described
shortly. The concluding remarks are drawn in the last section.

AES encryption needs a strong key. The stronger the key, the stronger your encryption. This is probably the weakest link in the chain. By strong, we mean not easily guessed and has sufficient entropy (or secure randomness).
