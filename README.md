### Abstract
ChaDRaL, an RGB image encryption process built on Chaos, DNA, RSA and LSB is introduced in this work. ChaDRaL leverages the advantages of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography as well as steganography. On one hand, the image is first encrypted with a symmetric algorithm combining DNA sequence operations and Lorenz chaotic system. On the other hand, the encryption key which is utilized to encrypt the media is now itself encrypted with an asymmetric algorithm i.e. RSA. Lastly, this encrypted key is concealed in the cipher image using LSB steganographic scheme. As a result, the problem of key transfer is also eliminated. A variety of test images are utilized to put the ChaDRaL algorithm to test. The suggested method’s security analysis reveals little correlation among image pixels, high entropy, and uniform distribution in histogram of cipher image. Also, it shows considerable performance in terms of established metrics such as UACI, NPCR, PSNR and SSIM. The simulation results demonstrate the capability of ChaDRaL to achieve quality encryption while resisting statistical and differential attacks.
